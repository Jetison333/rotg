# general rules
  - all trackers reset between rounds unless otherwise specified
  - GA will not suggest any changes to the submissions and will merely point out interpretations and consequences
  - GA will not become a player
  - if the GA doesn't notice your submission is invalid before stage 2 then it gets to slide
  
# meow meower
  - meows reset each round

# appendages
  - go into effect at the start of next round
  - part of the rulebook
    - persist across rounds
    - editable through submissions
  - the most recent player list is cycled in order without a schedule

## appendicks
  - appendicks persists across rounds (even though it's not specified)
  - an appendicks can only be appointed when the seat is currently empty
  - when appendicks is evicted:
    - a new one is immediately appointed
    - the old one can never be appointed ever again
    - the new appendicks immediately re-interprets the appendage

# tie breaker
  - only applies to score-based win conditions

# contracts
  - may be signed out of round
  - persist across rounds
  - *of specified duration* ideally
    - contracts of unspecified duration last for only this round or for as few rounds as it makes sense
  - contract conflict causes divine punishment
    - impossible clauses are treated the same way
  -  if its not possible to prove what actions would result from a contract then its not possible to enforce that contract and therefore its not "possible to proceed as if they were taken", so the contract is invalid
    - "being able to prove" has to be from existing information the players have, or information the GA is willing to tell them
    - which means *player obligations must be practically doable by the player* (death note-esque restrictions)
    - player obligations cannot involve an unknown/unspecified sequence of steps
    - *contract conditions must be resolvable by the players involved*
  - "I" is ambiguous and is interpreted by the GA
    - in a one-party contract it usually means the signer and not the author
  - Players cannot sign contracts that cannot be defined

# marbles
  - you get your new marbles during scoring *after* scores are done being calculated
  - marbles in hyperspace:
    - during scoring stage the marbles you're considered to have will also include `(#chips+49)//100`

# hats
  - you can wear anything you can think of (hats aren't items)
  - you can't wear something someone else is wearing
