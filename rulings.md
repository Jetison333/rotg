This documents the GA's intepretations of the rules to encourage consistency between rulings, acting as a form of FAQ.

As stated by:
> The Game Adminstrator has the final word on all issues regarding the interpretation of the rules text and on issues for which the rules text does not specify a resolution.

Disagreement is encouraged.

## general
- Roles, titles & submissions are not players nor can be used as references to one where naming a player is asked for unless the link is one-to-one and publicly known.
  
## meow meower
- meows reset each round

## Appendages
- “is a section of the rules”:
  - Editable through submissions.
- The most recent public player list (round results) is cycled in order without a schedule.
- Punctuation may be before or after your word.
- Words & punctuation:
  - Paragraph Breaks are puncutation.
  - Starting or ending a title is puncutation.
  - Word emphasis is allowed and does not count as punctutation.
  - Emoji can be punctuation or words depending on how they act, at the GA's discretion.

## Contracts
*[TODO: Trim]*
- contract conflict causes divine punishment
  - impossible clauses are treated the same way
    - the hell is divine punishment?
- if its not possible to prove what actions would result from a contract then its not possible to enforce that contract and therefore its not "possible to proceed as if they were taken", so the contract is invalid
  - "being able to prove" has to be from existing information the players have, or information the GA is willing to tell them
    - which means *player obligations must be practically doable by the player* (death note-esque restrictions)
      - this is the only part of this section of rulings that makes sense
  - player obligations cannot involve an unknown/unspecified sequence of steps
  - *contract conditions must be resolvable by the players involved*
    - you've already said this
- "I" is ambiguous and is interpreted by the GA
  - in a one-party contract it usually means the signer and not the author
- Players cannot sign contracts that cannot be defined
- If the GA has to decide between which “instantly” action happens first, the GA can decide which action happens first.
  - Unless some sort of thingy that is granted power by the rules says the player goes first.
    - my epsilon is smaller than yours!
  - Is instantly even real?  As above, players need to be practically doable.  Maybe we should get the competing players to do an actual race.  Though then the action wouldn't have been taken instantly after the gate…
- an identical copy of a contract can be signed by the same person as the other
  - could make a new contract with different wording and the same effect so there's little argument against
  - to forbid it would mean two people independently writing the same contract would hit weirdness weird as they'd kinda merge

## Wagon
- If a bidder wins but has lost marbles since they bid, so can no longer pay, it is treated as if they never bid.  Recurse.
