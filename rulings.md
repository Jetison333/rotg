## general rules
- all trackers reset between rounds unless otherwise specified
- GA will not suggest any changes to the submissions and will merely point out interpretations and consequences
- GA will not become a player
- A player is anyone who has made a submission before
- if the GA doesn't notice your submission is invalid before stage 2 then it gets to slide
- Roles, titles & submissions are not players nor can be used as references to one where naming a player is asked for unless the link is one-to-one and publicly known.
  
## meow meower
- meows reset each round

## Appendages
- go into effect at the start of next round
- part of the rulebook
  - persist across rounds
  - editable through submissions
- the most recent player list is cycled in order without a schedule

### Appendicks
- appendicks persists across rounds (even though it's not specified)
- an appendicks can only be appointed when the seat is currently empty
- when appendicks is evicted:
  - a new one is immediately appointed
  - the old one can never be appointed ever again
  - the new appendicks immediately re-interprets the appendage

## Tie breaker
- only applies to score-based win conditions

## Contracts
- may be signed out of round
- persist across rounds
- *of specified duration* ideally
  - contracts of unspecified duration last for only this round or for as few rounds as it makes sense
- contract conflict causes divine punishment
  - impossible clauses are treated the same way
-  if its not possible to prove what actions would result from a contract then its not possible to enforce that contract and therefore its not "possible to proceed as if they were taken", so the contract is invalid
  - "being able to prove" has to be from existing information the players have, or information the GA is willing to tell them
  - which means *player obligations must be practically doable by the player* (death note-esque restrictions)
  - player obligations cannot involve an unknown/unspecified sequence of steps
  - *contract conditions must be resolvable by the players involved*
- "I" is ambiguous and is interpreted by the GA
  - in a one-party contract it usually means the signer and not the author
- Players cannot sign contracts that cannot be defined
- if the GA has to decide between what two actions who happen "instantly" happen first, the GA can decide which action happens first. 
- an identical copy of a contract can be signed by the same person as the other
  - could make a new contract with different wording and the same effect so there's little argument against
  - to forbid it would mean two people independently writing the same contract would hit weirdness weird as they'd kinda merge

## Marbles
- you get your new marbles during scoring *after* scores are done being calculated

## Hats
- you can wear anything you can think of (hats aren't items)
- you can't wear something someone else is wearing

## Willbound
- Whoever authored the Willed Submission does not count as a player that round due to this authorship.  Also, "The Willbound", "as willed", and the Willed Submission do not count as players (see above).

## Wagon
- When there is only one bid, the second highest bid is the asking price.
