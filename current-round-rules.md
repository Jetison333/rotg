During stage 2 of any round, any player may spend 10 marbles (which disappear) and in return get 1 added to their score during the scoring stage of that round only.

Once this sentence exists in this document, rebecca is given 1 marble and this sentence is deleted.

## presidential selections

A presidential selection takes place every odd numbered round, during which the following happens:

During stage 1 any gamer may submit a presidential ticket, consisting of a contract text yet unsigned.
In stage 2 these tickets are revealed publicly, including who wrote each; subsequently, players may vote for any subset of the set of candidates.
In stage 3 the candidate who appeared in the most voters’ subsets (with ties broken by lowest marble count) wins the selection, becomes the President, and is immediately bound by the text of their submitted ticket contract for as long as they are President.
If lowest marble count fails to break the tie, the Game Adminstrator must arrange a fair and reasonable alternative tiebreaker.

As soon as reasonable after the selection, the President (new or reselected) must choose a cabinet, assigning each governmental office to some gamer.
For each office, the President may not choose themselves or anybody who doesn't want to be chosen.
A government officer may resign at any point, in which case the President must choose a replacement, subject to the same rule above.

## the treasurer

The Treasurer is a government office. 
The Treasure is a marble balance, separate from that of any gamer, which the Treasurer may roll marbles from as if it were their own.
Marbles may be rolled to the Treasure, but not shot at it.

When a gamer is taxed n marbles, it means that n of their marbles are forcibly rolled to the Treasure.
A gamer may not take an action if they can't pay all taxes associated with that action.
At the beginning of each round, each gamer is taxed the smallest of {0 marbles} and half their marble count rounded down.
When a gamer pays for an item at the farmers market, they are taxed {0 marbles}.
When a gamer pays for an item at the swindler's wagon, they are taxed {0 marbles}.

The Treasurer may freely edit text contained in curly brackets in the above paragraph, as long as the replacement text:
- does not have any side effects,
- does not itself contain any curly brackets.

Such changes must be announced publicly when they occur.
