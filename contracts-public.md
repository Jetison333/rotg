## poker chips (https://discord.com/channels/1320411924323893318/1346807889712386089/1358561004446814268)
> Every party to this contract will have a value associated with them. This value is equal to 1/100 of a marble, and will be called a chip in the rest of the contract. The following actions may be taken that will effect a parties chip balance. 
> 1. Deposit a marble - Places one of a parties marble into hyperspace (defined later in the contract) and adds 100 chips to that parties balance. If that party does not have a marble they can roll, this action fails.
> 2. Withdraw a marble - Takes one marble out of hyperspace and gives that marble to that party, and subtracts 100 chips from that parties balance. If that party does not have a minimum of 100 chips, this action fails.
> 3. Play a game - Any number of parties can play a game. All parties playing a game must agree to the following: The rules to the game and the method the game will be played, a number of chips to bet which is removed from each party's balance, and a payout structure which determines how many chips each player receives at the end of the game. This payout cannot be greater that the total of the bets each player put in. All parties playing the game must follow the agreed upon rules
> 4. Give a chip - Subtracts one chip from the party taking the action's balance, and adds one chip to another party to this contract. If the party doing the action does not have a minimum of 1 chip this action fails. 
>
> Hyperspace is a mechanism to allow a decentralized bank. Every party that is rolled a marble considered to be in hyperspace must immediately roll it to the next party of the contract. When a marble is deposited, that marble is considered to be in hyperspace, and the depositor must immediately roll that marble to another party of the contract. When a marble is withdrawn, then one marble that is currently in hyperspace is picked, and the next party to be rolled that marble must roll it to the party doing the withdrawal, and that marble is no longer considered to be in hyperspace. 
> If every party to this contract agrees, then this contract may be modified. If a party has zero chips, then that party may remove their signature from this contract. This contract lasts until every party has removed their signature
