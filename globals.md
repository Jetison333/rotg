Cursed Trinket

![](img/Cursed-trinket.png)

Upon the use of randomness, such as the rolling of dice, if some possibility would be the 'worst possible' result for you, the randomness is ignored and that possibility resolved by default.



# Deck
- The Fool: Create a new card and add it to the Discard.
- The Magician: Draw a card reversed: its effect is inverted.
- The High Priestess: Draw a card and see it, but do not resolve it. Place it back in the deck: it will be the next card drawn.
- The Empress: All players gain 3 marbles.
- The Emperor: Guess in the next round in which you do not submit. If you win, enact target entry from this round.
- The Hierophant: You *may* make a wish to the Game Administator: if it comes true, remember that nothing is without its price.
- The Lovers: Target player (not you) gains 4 marbles.
- The Chariot: Move target card from the Discard to the Deck.
- Strength: Target player draws a card.
- The Hermit: Everyone knows you drew this. When resolving your next stage 2, other players who guess you get 2 points.
- Wheel of Fortune: When you next make a choice, choose randomly.
- Justice: Gain 5 marbles, then negate the number printed on this card.
- The Hanged Man: Destroy target card from the Deck or Discard.
- Death: Relinquish target titloid (Game Administrator/Appendicks, any Tit(le), etc). If necessary, nominate a successor.
- Temperance: Keep this card. While held: You cannot draw further cards. Optionally, in response to any event: Nullify it, then discard this card. At any time: Discard this card.
- The Devil: Receive for free the itum in the Wagon with the lowest price.
- The Tower: Your current or next stage 2, another participant learns which entry you wrote.
- The Star: Destroy target item you hold.
- The Moon: Draw a card without knowing it. You do not know you drew The Moon. You think you drew a different card, but you did not.
  - Example: Alice chooses to draw a card. The Game Administrator determines that she drew The Moon. They draw an additional card, The Lovers, and decide to tell Alice that she drew Strength instead. Alice tries to use Strength on Bob, but Bob gains 4 marbles instead.
- The Sun: Gain 2 marbles.
- Judgement: Play the Game Administrator in a game you both agree on without ties. Draw 3 cards and resolve only 1: the winner chooses which.
- The World: Draw 2 additional cards.
