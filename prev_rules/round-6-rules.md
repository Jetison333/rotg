## Rules:

Each round is played in multiple stages. Stage 2 takes place after stage 1 ends, and the scoring stage takes place after stage 2 ends.

The Game Administrator has the final word on all issues regarding the interpretation of the rules text and on issues for which the rules text does not specify a resolution.

++/∘++/ = ++/∘++/∗

## Stage 1
During the duration of stage 1, any person on the server can make a "submission" by sending it to the Game Adminstrator through a direct message. 
From this point on, they are considered a "player" of the round. A player can only have 1 submission.

The submission must consist of a description of an alteration they wish to make to the rules text, described in any sufficiently easy to understand format.

## Stage 2
At the beginning of stage 2, the submissions given during stage 1 are shuffled, assigned numbers and made public.
The players are now tasked with determining which submission was uploaded by which player.
These "guesses" are represented as partial bijections, meaning that each submission is paired with at most 1 unique player and each player is paired with at most 1 unique submission.

The first time you guess, you learn how many of your neighboring entries have been guessed by you correctly

## Scoring stage
After stage 2, each player receives 1 point for each player they guessed, and loses 1 point for each player that guessed them.
The players with the most points are the winners of the round.

in case of a tie in points, whichever entry has a sha256 hash closer to the sha256 hash of the next tweet of the prime minister wins.  if there is a tie between sha256 hash closenesses, sha256 hash of the next next tweet tiebreaks.  repeat until the tie is resolved

"its the prime minister of poland" 

The rules alternations submitted by each of the winning players are all enacted by the Game Adminstrator, and go into effect at the start of the next round.

After the scoring stage ends the round is over, and a new one may begin.

## Marbles
Each player will now have a number of marbles that carry on into future rounds. This amount is public information. Players will start with zero marbles, and will earn one marble for each correct guess they make during the guessing phase. If a player tries to do an action that would result in some player having fewer than zero marbles, that action fails, with that player being told "you have lost your marbles". Further, each player gets their number of marbles divided by 10 and then rounded down added to their score during the scoring phase. The following actions can be made using marbles:
1. Rolling a marble - gives one of your marbles to a specified player
2. Shooting a marble - uses one of your marbles to remove one marble from a specified player
3. Buying an item - consumes a number of marbles for the specified effect
4. 100 marbles - win the game

## Messing with time
The durations of each stage and the time gaps between rounds are entirely determined by the Game Adminstrator. The Game Adminstrator may issue time extensions without the need to specify a reason for the extension.

# Contract law  
Players may enter into contracts with other players. In order for a contract to be valid, it must contain obligations and signatures and be submitted to the Game Adminstrator who will enforce the contract's terms. A contract may also contain penalties.   
## Obligations  
Any person who has an obligation is considered a party to a contract. An obligation constraints the future actions of each party to the contract. It may enforce positive action, such as but not limited to submitting a particular rule change submission, or telling a person some information. It may also enforce negative action, such as but not limited to not guessing a submission, or keeping information confidential. Conditions may be specified where an obligation only exists if those conditions are met. Obligations can only be actions that are related to the game, and cannot be things external to the game. If possible the Game Adminstrator should proceed as if obligations are followed, for example if a contract stipulates that a player must make a particular submission, then the game should proceed as if that player made that submission, even if the player attempted to submit something else.   
## Signature  
A valid contract must have a signature for every party in a contract. A signature is any proof that a party has accepted the contract that the Game Adminstrator is willing to accept.   
## Penalties  
In the case of obligations that cannot be ensured by the Game Adminstrator, penalties that will be applied if a party does not follow their obligations may be listed. A penalty is any obligation that can be enforced by the Game Adminstrator.   
  
# Meowing  
Players may meow, bark, or produce other such cute animal sounds.  These actions will be collectively referred to as “meowing” throughout the rest of this document.  Meowing is classified as an official game action, and as such will be tracked by the Game Adminstrator (see Meowing§Tracking).  Any and all collected meowing information and/or statistics are to be publicly available upon request from the Game Adminstrator.  
## Tracking  
Statistics about meowing performed by players, including but not limited to frequency and number of occurrences, are tracked by the Game Adminstrator.  The Game Adminstrator MUST track this information in a privacy-friendly manner, i.e. a manner which does not allow individuals to be identified from their informwation being tracked.  
  
# Endorsements  
At the end of each round, after guesses are finalized and scores are calculated, but before identities or guesses or scores are announced or any new rules are enacted, each Player is given (in private) the choice to either Endorse any individual Player, or not. Here a Player is anyone who submitted in the round in question.   
  
Next, for every Player P, compute P's Endorsement Score as 1 + (the sum of the Endorsement Scores of every Player that Endorsed P). To keep this well defined, disregard every Player that is part of a cycle in the directed graph of Endorsements: those players' Endorsement Scores are effectively zero.  
  
If the rules define a role of "President", then replace 1 in the above equation with 3 when P is the President.  
  
Then, the Player(s) with the greatest Endorsement Scores have their rule submission enacted, the same as if they had won through guessing.  
  
The information about who Endorsed whom is revealed by the Game Adminstrator along with everything else at the end of the round.  
  
# Tab 4  
  
# Appendagealism  
  
The Appendage is a section of the rules.  
  
Going around the most recent player list, each player may append a word and optional punctuation mark to the Appendage.  They must be able to know the contents if desired (such as being public, or sent to them).  When reaching the end of the player list, repeat.  
  
Sentences in the Appendage aren't considered rules until completed by appropriate punctuation.  
  
Interpretation (but not enforcement) of the Appendage is up to the Appendicks, who is nominated by the Game Adminstrator (they cannot nominate themselves).  If over 50% of players from the previous and current round agree the Appendicks is causing Appendicitis, then Appendectomy is is performed, Entity *Appendicks=0;
