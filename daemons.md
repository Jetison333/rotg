> 2) unconditionally and forever send all the marbles in the Treasure to me, the duuuumon 'At Least Death Doesn't Happen to You Every Year'


## Pyramid
This deemon will be known as The pyramid. This demon does nothing besides the following: 

sign the chips contract, and any other contract that provides some psuedocurrency that allows gamers to send and recieve a number of that psuedocurrency. 

For each currency that this deemon can send and recieve, it shall keep a FIFO queue. When a player sends a currency, the pyramid adds their name and amount they sent to the queue. 

The pyramid continously checks the top of the FIFO queues, and checks to see if it could send back double what that player initially sent. If it can, it does, and removes that entry from the queue


## Butler
This damon's name is Butler. Butler signs whatever contracts that Jetison333 tells them too.
