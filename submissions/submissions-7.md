Tytle the followyng rule "George" et wryte it anywhere, a sectyon of its own:  
%%%%%%
## Deck
The Deck is a collection of cards without order. The Deck and its contents are to be remembered publicly forevermore. The Discard is a collection of cards with order. The Discard and its contents are to be remembered publicly forevermore.

At any time one may draw a uniformly random card from the Deck. When a card is drawn, its effect is triggered by the one who drew it, and it is subsequently placed on the Discard. When one draws from an empty Deck, the names and properties of the Deck and Discard are first swapped. If the Deck is still empty, they draw The End, which removes George from the rules text.

Effects are not optional. If an effect cannot be resolved, it is not.

All cards have effects. Otherwise, cards is all they are.

Then tytle the followyng rule "Jerry" et wryte it anywhere also:  
%%%%%%  
When any player begins to breathe out: Add all cards below to the Deck, then remove Jerry from the rules text.

- The Fool: Create a new card and add it to the Discard.
- The Magician: Draw a card reversed: its effect is inverted.
- The High Priestess: Draw a card and see it, but do not resolve it. Place it back in the deck: it will be the next card drawn.
- The Empress: All players gain 3 marbles.
- The Emperor: Guess in the next round in which you do not submit. If you win, enact target entry from this round.
- The Hierophant: You *may* make a wish to the Game Administator: if it comes true, remember that nothing is without its price.
- The Lovers: Target player (not you) gains 4 marbles.
- The Chariot: Move target card from the Discard to the Deck.
- Strength: Target player draws a card.
- The Hermit: Everyone knows you drew this. When resolving your next stage 2, other players who guess you get 2 points.
- Wheel of Fortune: When you next make a choice, choose randomly.
- Justice: Gain 5 marbles, then negate the number printed on this card.
- The Hanged Man: Destroy target card from the Deck or Discard.
- Death: Relinquish target titloid (Game Administrator/Appendicks, any Tit(le), etc). If necessary, nominate a successor.
- Temperance: Keep this card. While held: You cannot draw further cards. Optionally, in response to any event: Nullify it, then discard this card. At any time: Discard this card.
- The Devil: Receive for free the itum in the Wagon with the lowest price.
- The Tower: Your current or next stage 2, another participant learns which entry you wrote.
- The Star: Destroy target item you hold.
- The Moon: Draw a card without knowing it. You do not know you drew The Moon. You think you drew a different card, but you did not.
  - Example: Alice chooses to draw a card. The Game Administrator determines that she drew The Moon. They draw an additional card, The Lovers, and decide to tell Alice that she drew Strength instead. Alice tries to use Strength on Bob, but Bob gains 4 marbles instead.
- The Sun: Gain 2 marbles.
- Judgement: Play the Game Administrator in a game you both agree on without ties. Draw 3 cards and resolve only 1: the winner chooses which.
- The World: Draw 2 additional cards.

## The Ghost of Guessing Past

During the Guessing Phase, the Willbound must write a submission that follows the Will, a contrived requirement, left to them by their ancestor.  Then write a Will, and pick their descendant.

If the Willbound does not do their duty, the Game Adminstrator chooses a next-of-kin to be Willbound next round.

The Willed submission appears in addition to other submissions in the next Guessing Phase, and “*as willed.*” appears in the player list.

The Will and who is or was Willbound are not made public by the Game Adminstrator, but the Willbound is not forbidden from telling.
 
Players gain a point for correctly guessing which is the Willed submission, and it looses a point each time it is guessed correctly.  It gains points equal to the average correct guesses this round.  It is distinct from the player who was Willbound and their submission, if any.

# 3
every new rule applies retroactively, assuming everyone in past rounds would have acted in the same way with the rule as they did without.

# 4
This is a silly game. Participants of all roles must not stress too much about unforeseen consequences of their actions, for those are what make the game fun.
