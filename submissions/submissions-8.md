 ## Marbles
-Each player will now have a number of marbles that carry on into future rounds. This amount is public information. Players will start with zero marbles, and will earn one marble for each correct guess they make during the guessing phase. If a player tries to do an action that would result in some player having fewer than zero marbles, that action fails, with that player being told "you have lost your marbles". Further, each player gets their number of marbles divided by 10 and then rounded down added to their score during the scoring phase. The following actions can be made using marbles:
-1. Rolling a marble - gives one of your marbles to a specified player
-2. Shooting a marble - uses one of your marbles to remove one marble from a specified player
-4. 100 marbles - win the game

+People may enter into contracts with other people. In order for a contract to be valid, it must contain obligations and signatures and be submitted to the Game Adminstrator who will enforce the contract's terms. A contract may also contain penalties.   
 ## Obligations  
-Any person who has an obligation is considered a party to a contract. An obligation constraints the future actions of each party to the contract. It may enforce positive action, such as but not limited to submitting a particular rule change submission, or telling a person some information. It may also enforce negative action, such as but not limited to not guessing a submission, or keeping information confidential. Conditions may be specified where an obligation only exists if those conditions are met. Obligations can only be actions that are related to the game, and cannot be things external to the game. If possible the Game Adminstrator should proceed as if obligations are followed, for example if a contract stipulates that a player must make a particular submission, then the game should proceed as if that player made that submission, even if the player attempted to submit something else.
