## Scoring stage
After stage 2, each player receives 1 point for each player they guessed, and loses 1 point for each player that guessed them.
-The players with the most points are the winners of the round.
+The players with the most points, and the players with the least guesses on their entries are the winners of the round.
```

# 4.
At the end of the scoring stage, before the author of each entry is revealed to any player, the player(s) with the lowest score this round ("losers") are given an unspecified time to choose 1 of the "events" specified by this document. The text of the chosen event goes into effect immediately. All losers learn who each other are for this decision process, and must decide unanimously. If they decide not to choose any event, or fail to do so in the allotted time, no event occurs.

If an event says a value is "chosen", it is chosen by the losers. The choice must be unanimous, just as the choice of event is. If an event causes the scores to change, such as by changing guesses, any new set of losers does *not* choose another event. Only 1 event can occur per round.

## Events
- Fair Ballot: Players' guesses are not revealed.
- Smokescreen: Entries' authors are not revealed.
- Slack-cutting: All players of rank 1 or 2 this round are "winners", and their rules are enacted.
- Last Chance: Each loser learns which of their own guesses are correct, then may change their guesses whoever they like.
- Motion of No Confidence: The losers learn which entries are winning. A chosen one of these is announced to all players, and a vote is held on whether it should be enacted. If over 50% of players vote "no", the rule is struck down. The author of a rule which is struck down may choose any non-winning entry to be enacted to take its place.

# 5.
One random player gets an ability to swap their entry with a player of their choice. The player they swapped with gets to know what player their entry was swapped with. Both players still have to guess each other's entries.

## Rules:

-Each round is played in multiple stages. Stage 2 takes place after stage 1 ends, and the scoring stage takes place after stage 2 ends.

The Game Administrator has the final word on all issues regarding the interpretation of the rules text and on issues for which the rules text does not specify a resolution.

-## Stage 1
-During the duration of stage 1, any person on the server can make a "submission" by sending it to the Game Adminstrator through a direct message. 
-From this point on, they are considered a "player" of the round. A player can only have 1 submission.

-The submission must consist of a description of an alteration they wish to make to the rules text, described in any sufficiently easy to understand format.

-## Stage 2
-At the beginning of stage 2, the submissions given during stage 1 are shuffled, assigned numbers and made public.
-The players are now tasked with determining which submission was uploaded by which player.
-These "guesses" are represented as partial bijections, meaning that each submission is paired with at most 1 unique player and each player is paired with at most 1 unique submission.

-## Scoring stage
-After stage 2, each player receives 1 point for each player they guessed, and loses 1 point for each player that guessed them.
-The players with the most points are the winners of the round.

-in case of a tie in points, whichever entry has a sha256 hash closer to the sha256 hash of the next tweet of the prime minister wins.  if there is a tie between sha256 hash closenesses, sha256 hash of the next next tweet tiebreaks.  repeat until the tie is resolved

"its the prime minister of poland" 

-The rules alternations submitted by each of the winning players are all enacted by the Game Adminstrator, and go into effect at the start of the next round.

-After the scoring stage ends the round is over, and a new one may begin.

-## Messing with time
-The durations of each stage and the time gaps between rounds are entirely determined by the Game Adminstrator. The Game Adminstrator may issue time extensions without the need to specify a reason for the extension.

h,m that's hard. five per bowl?

add two winners, abdication and mow mower

It's possible to pass custard along.

üòµ‚Äçüí´ can I just say "there has to be more than 1 winner"

Once per round (not per player; more than one player may not issue a challenge in a given round), during stage 2, a player may challenge the submitter of a given submission to a duel of [God Field](<https://godfield.net/>). In order to do so, they must announce their intent to the Game Administrator, providing the number of the submission which they wish to challenge the author of, no later than ‚Öî of the allotted time for stage 2 before the deadline. The Game Administrator should then reveal publicly which submission belongs to the challenger, and set an appropriate time for the challenge such that both parties can reasonably participate. This time may be announced publicly.
The duel should be a hidden melee game involving only the challenger and challengee, with the room password "rotg7312" and with the apocalypse setting set to start at G.F. 50. Both players should use the "Solo" mode.

After the game, the change in the challengee's score Œîx is determined thus:
* if the challenger won the game: Œîx = y - 15, where y is the amount of money the challengee had at the end of the match.
* if the challenger lost the game: Œîx = min(15 - y, 0), where y is the amount of money the challenger had at the end of the match.
* if the game ended in a draw: Œîx = 0.

In the scoring phase, Œîx is added to the challengee's score. Preferably, the result should be assessed by the Game Administrator spectating the match; however, the Game Administrator may choose another way of assessing the result at their own discretion.
If, due to technical constraints, timing constraints or otherwise, it is impossible to organize a duel, the game administrator may take any action at their discretion, provided it preserves the order of the other players when sorted by score at the end of the round.

3: Once per round during stage two, each player can ask a single yes or no question about an entry that will be answered accurately by the game administrator

The first time you guess, you learn how many of your neighboring entries have been guessed by you correctly

# 13.
In stage 1, users will be presented with a "prompt". A prompt consists of a "problem" specification and "language requirements", a set of languages that must include Python 3. The prompt is set by the winner of the previous round before stage 1 begins.
In stage 2, submissions must include source code that solves the problem in any of the languages listed in the language requirements. Submissions may be denied if they meet all of the following criteria:
- The code was written after the challenge for the round was announced
- The code was written by a member of the server
- The author of the code is not the one who submitted it

At the end of each round, after guesses are finalized and scores are calculated, but before identities or guesses or scores are announced or any new rules are enacted, each player is given (in private) the choice to either Endorse any individual player, or not. Here a player is anyone who submitted in the round in question.
Next, for every player P, compute P's Endorsement Score as 1 + (the sum of the Endorsement Scores of every player that endorsed P). To keep this well defined, disregard every player that is part of a cycle in the directed graph of endorsements: those players' endorsement scores are effectively zero.
If the rules define a role of "President", then replace 1 in the above equation with 3 when P is the President.
Then, the player(s) with the greatest Endorsement Scores have their rule submission enacted, the same as if they had won through guessing.
The information about who Endorsed whom is revealed by the Game Adminstrator along with everything else at the end of the round.

# Honor

Each player starts with 1 **Honor**. **Honor** is preserved between rounds, even if the player misses some of them, and is non-transferrable. Players with less than 0 **Honor** cannot be the winner of Rule of the Guessers. If a player is about to have less than -1 **Honor** due to losing **Honor**, they will have -1 **Honor** instead but no more than their current **Honor**.  

# Duels

During the Scoring Stage, each player of the round may **challenge** another to a **duel**. The timeframe when a duel can be initiated may be limited by the Game Administrator (a duel proceeding shall extend this timeframe). If either party is currently in any stage of the dueling or duel initiation process any duel requests from or to them are postponed into a FIFO queue (reset after round ends) until this no longer applies. A player may successfully initiate no more than 3 duels per round.  
When one player (henceforth known as the Initiator) challenges another to a duel (henceforth known as the Opponent), the Opponent may either refuse or accept it. The Game Administrator may choose to limit the amount of time the Opponent is alloted to respond. If the Opponent does not respond to the challenge in the alloted time, the duel does not proceed and the Opponent loses 2 **Honor** (0 if the Initiator has ever cheated). If the Opponent refuses the duel, the duel does not proceed and the Opponent loses 1 **Honor** (0 if the Initiator has ever cheated).  

Otherwise, the duel then proceeds as follows.  
The Duelers each shall choose up to 3 and no less than 1 competitive two-player games that all of them are able to play. The choices are not required to be public, and the identities of each choice's chooser may be concealed from the Game Administrator, if a protocol facilitating this is agreed upon by all parties involved (the Duelers and the Game Administrator). The Game Administrator may choose to limit the amount of time the Duelers have to make their choices. If the time is over and none of the Duelers have made their choices, the duel does not proceed and the Duelers lose 3 **Honor**.  
The Game Administrator then chooses the game to be played from the pool of Duelers' choices. If the Game Administrator determines that none of the games suggested are fair they may instead come up with another game entirely.  

The Duelers shall play the game against each other until one of them wins. The Game Administrator may set a time limit, and if it is reached the duel is over and the Duelers lose 4 **Honor**. Once the game concludes, all points awarded to the losing player by guessing will be **removed** from the losing player and **added** to the winning player. The winning player gains 1 **Honor**. The Duelers may not be challenged to a duel until next round, but may initiate a duel themselves.  
If it is determined that a Dueler has cheated at the game (as defined by the game), the cheater loses 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 **Honor** and is considered to have lost the game even if they have won, including for scoring purposes, unless all Duelers have cheated at the game, in which case things proceed as if this did not happen, but regardless the cheating Duelers are to be permanently tainted with the cheater mark.
