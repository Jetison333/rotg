# 1:
# Only the winners of the previous round may make a submission

# 2:
## Abdication
When a round is not ongoing, the current Game Administrator may *abdicate* their position, transferring the role of Game Administrator to any willing person who has played at least 1 round of rules guessing.
At the end of round 1 (when this rule is passed), @ubq323 becomes the Game Administrator.

# 3:
Once per round during stage two, each player can ask a single yes or no question about an entry that will be answered accurately by the game administrator

# 4:
in case of a tie in points, whichever entry has a sha256 hash closer to the sha256 hash of the next tweet of the prime minister wins.  if there is a tie between sha256 hash closenesses, sha256 hash of the next next tweet tiebreaks.  repeat until the tie is resolved

"its the prime minister of poland" 

# 5:
## piccy piccy!

At any point each round, each player can share a little drawing, scribble, or other 2D image they have made. This excludes projections of 3D objects into 2D, but in photos of 2D objects (like a painting), the 2D object counts as a 2D image. This could be a computer scribble, a cryptic mashup of random images, a miniature zine.

Doing so grants the player one point once that round.

## meow meow

players may meow

increases meow meow by meow

the *Mow Mower* keeps record of meow meow

## *Adminstrator

All future postings of the *Rules* by the *Game Adminstrator*, including sections of the *Rules* which were not authored by the *Game Adminstrator*, must ensure capitalised names referring to entities bound by, or granted powers by, *Rule of the Guessers* do not match so-called correct spelling as per *Wiktionary, The free dictionary*.  Words in the game's title are excluded from this rule.

Conventionally, this is performed by dropping a vowel.

# 6:
The length of all the submissions must be divisible by 7

# 7:
A point is deducted from a player's submission for the current Rules Guessing round whenever they gain a point in a different event hosted by the code guessing discord server (including code guessing)

## Stage 2

At the beginning of stage 2, the submissions given during stage 1 are shuffled, assigned numbers and made public.
The players are now tasked with determining which submission was uploaded by which player.
These "guesses" are represented as partial bijections, meaning that each submission is paired with at most 1 unique player and each player is paired with at most 1 unique submission.
+Additionally, each player may give any number of submissions a "star".

## Scoring stage

After stage 2, each player receives 1 point for each player they guessed, and loses 1 point for each player that guessed them.
The players with the most points are the winners of the round.
+ The players with the most stars received are also the winners of the round.
The rules alternations submitted by each of the winning players are all enacted by the Game Adminstrator, and go into effect at the start of the next round.

# 9:
The players with the median points are the winners of the round.
