Submissions must be valid diffs for the rules document  
  
# 3.  
# Contract law  
Players may enter into contracts with other players. In order for a contract to be valid, it must contain obligations and signatures and be submitted to the Game Adminstrator who will enforce the contract's terms. A contract may also contain penalties.   
## Obligations  
Any person who has an obligation is considered a party to a contract. An obligation constraints the future actions of each party to the contract. It may enforce positive action, such as but not limited to submitting a particular rule change submission, or telling a person some information. It may also enforce negative action, such as but not limited to not guessing a submission, or keeping information confidential. Conditions may be specified where an obligation only exists if those conditions are met. Obligations can only be actions that are related to the game, and cannot be things external to the game. If possible the Game Adminstrator should proceed as if obligations are followed, for example if a contract stipulates that a player must make a particular submission, then the game should proceed as if that player made that submission, even if the player attempted to submit something else.   
## Signature  
A valid contract must have a signature for every party in a contract. A signature is any proof that a party has accepted the contract that the Game Adminstrator is willing to accept.   
## Penalties  
In the case of obligations that cannot be ensured by the Game Adminstrator, penalties that will be applied if a party does not follow their obligations may be listed. A penalty is any obligation that can be enforced by the Game Adminstrator.   
  
# Meowing  
Players may meow, bark, or produce other such cute animal sounds.  These actions will be collectively referred to as “meowing” throughout the rest of this document.  Meowing is classified as an official game action, and as such will be tracked by the Game Adminstrator (see Meowing§Tracking).  Any and all collected meowing information and/or statistics are to be publicly available upon request from the Game Adminstrator.  
## Tracking  
Statistics about meowing performed by players, including but not limited to frequency and number of occurrences, are tracked by the Game Adminstrator.  The Game Adminstrator MUST track this information in a privacy-friendly manner, i.e. a manner which does not allow individuals to be identified from their informwation being tracked.  
  
# Endorsements  
At the end of each round, after guesses are finalized and scores are calculated, but before identities or guesses or scores are announced or any new rules are enacted, each Player is given (in private) the choice to either Endorse any individual Player, or not. Here a Player is anyone who submitted in the round in question.   
  
Next, for every Player P, compute P's Endorsement Score as 1 + (the sum of the Endorsement Scores of every Player that Endorsed P). To keep this well defined, disregard every Player that is part of a cycle in the directed graph of Endorsements: those players' Endorsement Scores are effectively zero.  
  
If the rules define a role of "President", then replace 1 in the above equation with 3 when P is the President.  
  
Then, the Player(s) with the greatest Endorsement Scores have their rule submission enacted, the same as if they had won through guessing.  
  
The information about who Endorsed whom is revealed by the Game Adminstrator along with everything else at the end of the round.  
  
# Tab 4  
  
# Appendagealism  
  
The Appendage is a section of the rules.  
  
Going around the most recent player list, each player may append a word and optional punctuation mark to the Appendage.  They must be able to know the contents if desired (such as being public, or sent to them).  When reaching the end of the player list, repeat.  
  
Sentences in the Appendage aren't considered rules until completed by appropriate punctuation.  
  
Interpretation (but not enforcement) of the Appendage is up to the Appendicks, who is nominated by the Game Adminstrator (they cannot nominate themselves).  If over 50% of players from the previous and current round agree the Appendicks is causing Appendicitis, then Appendectomy is is performed, Entity *Appendicks=0;

# 4.  
The author of this submission has right to create as much rules as they wish, at any time. The rules should be added as is, meaning no other entity (including the game administrator) has the right to reject or modify them.  
  
# 5.  
Rule of the Guesser rounds that begin after a full moon are wererounds. In a wereround the Game Adminstrator must choose one unimplemented rule from each previous round to be included in the rules of the wereround.

After stage 1, the submissions are randomly divided as evenly as possible into ⌈N/13⌉ "buckets", where N is the number of submissions. For instance, a round with 6 submissions would have 1 bucket with all 6 submissions, a round with 17 submissions would have a bucket of size 9 and a bucket of size 8, and a round with 28 submissions would have a bucket of size 10 and 2 buckets of size 9.  
  
Each bucket is assigned a unique index, starting from 1 and increasing consecutively. The bucket that each entry is in, as well as the bucket that each player's entry is in, is public information from stage 2 onward.

# 10.  
now is the time for many a crime in sending a rule dredged up from the drool perhaps penned by a fool (though i am one of you) but its content is mush that is owed to the slush yet without repartee the rule is to be a limit imposed on everything we would later propose to the r.o.t.g. like all of the rest but this case is closed as mine is the best the restriction is thus: to pass the test, be olus you must.

# 11.  
The Empire didn't encourage its subjects to go far away, in case they saw things that might disturb them. For the same reason it had built a wall around the entire country, patrolled by the Heavenly Guard whose main function was to tread heavily on the fingers of any inhabitants who felt they might like to step outside for a few minutes for a breath of fresh air.  
  
This didn't happen often, because most of the subjects of the Sun Emperor were quite happy to live inside the Wall. It's a fact of life that everyone is on one side or other of a wall, so the only thing to do is forget about it or evolve stronger fingers.
