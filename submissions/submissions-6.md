# 1
This rule shall overwrite current scoring rules.
Whenever a player guesses an entry-player pair correctly, they earn points equal to the index of that guess in their ordered list of guesses. The list's indices correspond to terms in the Lucas sequence, which begins {2, 1} and has each successive term equal in value to the sum of the values of the two terms prior. A list of guesses will be reduced by the Game Admin i strator or someone else in power, if there is no Game Admin i strator, to have no empty guesses or other somesuch nonsense.
Incorrect guesses will earn a player points equal to the index of each guess in their ordered list of guesses. The list's indices correspond to terms in the Fibonacci sequence, which ends {-1, 0} and has each prior term equal to the difference between the values of the two terms successive. A list of guesses, reductio ad absurdum, meow.
For this round only, if a player guesses this entry incorrectly, they earn additional Bonus Points equal to the number of minutes since the minute of the current Appendicks' birth.

# 2
Each stage, you may visit the Game Adminstrator to learn 2 things in private: 1 is true & 1 is false.

# 3
Remove
“3. Buying an item - consumes a number of marbles for the specified effect”

Replace
“The durations of each stage and the time gaps between rounds”
with
“The durations of stages, happenings of undefined length, and the time gaps between rounds”

Add, somewhere:
“A "person" is anyone the Game Adminstrator acknowledges as having ever taken action within the game.”


Add to the Stage 1 section:
### Rounds of Restriction

Every third round is a themed round, which has some contrived restriction or theme upon submissions.

The previous winner of a themed round agrees with the Game Admin on what this will be.


## The Swindler's Wagon

The Swindler is an esteemed role, an important member of the community who supplies itums to those most in need.

Their Wagon is a persistent collection of itums and prices.

The Swindler may optionally:
- discard a chosen itum from the wagon
- provide a description &c of an itum to stock into the wagon
Then they sellout, choosing another player or the Game Adminstrator to become the Swindler.  Each player may be Swindler only once per round.

The Game Adminstrator names prices for all wagon itums, and may change them at will.  A price must include some amount marbles or other money, and may include other things too.

If who's the Swindler is unclear, or the they have not taken an action for half a Pluto-day (~3 Earth-days), the Game Adminstrator may take their role.

### Till

When a player moves to buy an itum, the itum is taken from the Wagon and bidding is started.  Players from the past two rounds may bid privately.  All bids must have at least the counts in the asking price or higher, and may not include things not in the price.  Bids are rejected if they cannot be proven payable.

When bidding ends, the person with the highest bid gets the itum, and they pay the second highest bid.  Neither the Game Adminstrator nor Swindler receive the payment.


### mideas

Not as part of this rule, the authors suggest the following as itums for the Game Adminstrator to start the Wagon with, or just as sparks for the Swindler's imagination:
- Receipt — When used choose any player's itum to return to the Wagon
- Marble Jar — Contains how many marbles it was bought for.  these may not be shot.
- Appendage Pro Subscription — Pro subscribers append two words at a time.
- Invisible Ink — add a clause to a contract that other signers cannot see.
- Twins — Unilaterally destroy a contract.
- Pawn A — If held by the same player for 6 consecutive rounds, becomes Queen A.  Then, when used with Queen B, the user becomes Game Adminstrator.
- Pawn B —  〃 swap A & B.
- Hailstones — Sacrifice all points in Scoring and have every other player gain a Marble.
- Various Hats, Cat Ears, etc
- Itums don't need to do anything special!
- Pokéball — https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=BDaH0OF_zFY
- Weighted Bag — Swap with another person's item.


## Itums

Itums have a name and description.  Optionally they can have a little drawing too.  There can not exist identical itums.

The holder of an itum is affected by it's description.  Interpretation of what each itum actually bloody does is up the the Game Adminstrator.

Itums cannot override explicit rules, however are free to play with the rules and alter the game.


## Insert Tits Here

The Game Adminstrator may choose to give people Tit(le)s, to slack off on work.

Tit(le)s must be amusingly named, if they are found not they are instantly revoked.

There is only one of each Tit(le), and the Game Adminstrator may grant and revoke them.

A Tit(le) grants the holder the Game Adminstrator's abilities from a selection of the rules text.  That is, the Game Adminstrator picks a subset of the rules text (not necessarily contiguous), and a person - this selection of the rules text now applies as though instances of "the Game Adminstrator" (et sim.) were replaced with the person's name.


## sorry

any player may ohno at the cost of sorry
