## Marbles
Each player will now have a number of marbles that carry on into future rounds. This amount is public information. Players will start with zero marbles, and will earn one marble for each correct guess they make during the guessing phase. If a player tries to do an action that would result in some player having fewer than zero marbles, that action fails, with that player being told "you have lost your marbles". Further, each player gets their number of marbles divided by 10 and then rounded down added to their score during the scoring phase. The following actions can be made using marbles:
1. Rolling a marble - gives one of your marbles to a specified player
2. Shooting a marble - uses one of your marbles to remove one marble from a specified player
3. Buying an item - consumes a number of marbles for the specified effect
4. 100 marbles - win the game

During the guessing phase, a Player may give any number of submissions a star. Stars do not reset between rounds. The uses of stars can only be specified in the apendage.
