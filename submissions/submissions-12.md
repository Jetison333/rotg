> ## The Octahedron
> 
> The Octahedron is supreme.  No infintesimal may come to be above it.  The Octrahedron cannot begone.  A chain of events does not lead to the Octahedron's non-existence, for a lack of existence of the Octahedron necessitates those events do not exist.  You cannot not have what permits to have.
> 
> - The Octahedron exists iff the Game continues.
> 
> -# *Our product proposes a unification of this existential existence's extermination, providing a centralised solution to the destruction of all, and hereby obviating any from the need to spend time considering why they exist: it's as simple as not using the unified destructor.*
> 
> ### The Oct
> 
> Those that hold a face are collectively known the Oct.
> 
> When there is a disagreement over how the game should continue, a contradiction in the rules, a vote is started.  All allocated faces of the Oct must participate.
> 
> Instant Runoff Voting is used:  Each participant ranks the proposed paths from one to N.  If every participant's 1st is the same, it happens from source of the Octahedron.  Otherwise the paths with the least 1sts are eliminated, the gaps in each ranking shifted up, and loop recounting the 1st.
> 
> When three faces gather, they may agree to re-allocate any faces to and from any Gamer, except those necessitated by the rules.
> 
> The following must have a face:
> - The Game Administator
> - The Attorney Specifc, which is a Governmental Office.
> - The daemon “Two wolves and a lamb deciding what to eat for lunch.”, if such a daemon exists.
> - The Meow Meower Subordinate.
> 
> -# *All forgets.  Since time unrememerable, each face has been separated in space.  However, for all to exist the Octahedron must be, so it is presumed there is a fourth dimension - linking all together.*
(edit the Meow section to be:)
> ## Meow Meowing
> 
> Gamers may meow, bark, or produce other such cute animal sounds.  These actions will be collectively referred to as “meowing”.  Meowing is classified as a game action.
> 
> The gamer which has proven they have meowed second most this round is the Meow Meower Subordinate.
> 
> -# *SUB WOOF WOOFER*
